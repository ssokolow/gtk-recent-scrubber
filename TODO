Plans for further promotion:
- Prepare a setup.py to make packaging easier
- Write and test RPM specfiles and .deb packaging stuff
- Write a basic ebuild which makes use of setup.py (Possibly add to my general

- Explore packaging for Slackware (and, therefore, for Slax) and AUR.
- Look into how much I can automate use of OpenSUSE Build Service.
- Look into how that one Linux games site apparently added an RPM source for
  SuSE via a URL.
