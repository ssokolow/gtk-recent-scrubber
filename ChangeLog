**NOTE:** A unicode-related mistake was revealed during the process of porting
from Python 2.x to Python 3.x. You may need to re-add any paths in your
blacklist which contain non-ASCII characters.

- Port from Python 2.x to 3.x
- Port from PyGTK and GTK+ 2.x to PyGObject and GTK 3.x
- Add MyPy type annotations and vim modeline to the code
- Switch from optparse to argparse for argument parsing
